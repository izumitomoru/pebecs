essentially:
-- entity
some form of identification (INDEX)
indicates what components are associated with it (by id, i suppose) allowing instant access manipulation
bitmasks can be used to do this (and do it well, i assume)
so seemingly the id doesn't have to be in order like i for some reason thought it should be

-- component
raw data to be manipulated by systems
packed closely together in memory, should be contiguous
archetypes can be used to mitigate the problem of entities who don't use some components and waste iterations
sparse sets are also used to accomplish this
also have ids possibly?
preferably able to add and remove components from entities without too much trouble

-- system
set of functions to manipulate component data

i THINK there is ONE single packed array for entities, and each system owns a sparse array.

i do not understand any of this

---- planning
i will likely go with sparse sets since i didn't quite like the sound of archetypes
